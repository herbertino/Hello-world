# Hello-world
My first repository as an intern with HNG, I'm looking forward to learning new things


This is the first time i am coming across GITHUB. So far it's not been easy. 
All of this seems new to me. 
At first it felt like i had no idea what i was doing. 
Honestly speaking, am not sure i have an idea what am doing. 
I have tried to add a branch but each time i commit a readme.txt i hit a dead end on the branch master.
I don't intend to get everything under a day though.
But i know i've improved. 
I've moved a step and i wish to keep moving and not stop till i've achieved what i intend to achieve.
